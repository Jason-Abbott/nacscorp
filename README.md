- Created: 1996
- Platform: EMWACS (precursor to Microsoft IIS) and Perl CGI

Working as the service manager in the computer department of a campus retailer afforded early access to high speed Internet. I used the opportunity to learn HTML, Perl and CGI (the tools of the time) to build a retail website.

[That website](https://github.com/Jason-Abbott/university-of-idaho-bookstore) caught the attention of our supplier who considered it the best they'd seen, so they brought me to their headquarters in Cleveland to build an online, searchable catalog of their entire product offering.

# Innovations

There was no such thing as e-commerce when I built these sites. There were no online forums to consult. I learned Perl on my own and figured out how to use it to parse mainframe file exports (product data) to present on web pages through CGI.
