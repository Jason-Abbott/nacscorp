<h3><a name="OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h3><br>
NACSCORP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National 
Association of College Stores, was established to provide products and 
services for NACS member stores.  Our mission is to build long-term 
relationships with our customers by helping each one of them succeed.  
All of our customers are college bookstores or other educational 
resellers.
<br><br>                    
NACSCORP distributes products which are important to 
the students, faculty, and staff of college and university campuses.  
We currently list over 60,000 items from more than 500 publishers and 
manufacturers.  We provide content products, such as books and 
multimedia titles, and tools important in education, such as computer 
software, peripherals, and supplies.
<br><br>                     
We carry a broad selection of books in the following 
categories: university press and other academic titles, reference 
books, test preparation and study guides, professional and technical 
titles, computer books, children's books, and an assortment of 
remainders.  Most of our trade titles are used for course adoption.
<br><br>                    
Software and peripheral products include popular PC- 
and Mac-based products, as well as more specialized products that have 
an application in higher education.  Many software titles have 
educational pricing (significant discounts for faculty and students).  
NACSCORP's large selection of mutimedia titles includes many 
educational and reference titles, as well as the latest games and 
edutainment titles.
<br><br>                     
We also support software volume licensing programs from 
seven top software publishers.  Volume licensing programs allow 
college stores to offer discounts to labs, departments, and other 
institutional customers.
<br><br>                    
Our services and policies were created in direct 
response to the needs of our customers.  The following pages provide 
an outline of our policies and information on ordering, shipping, 
payments, and returns.  <b><i>If you have any comments or suggestions, 
please let us know.  We are here to help! </b></i>

<i>Order hours (Eastern Time): 8 AM-7 PM Monday-Thursday; 8 AM-6 PM Friday</i><br>

<b>Easylink</b> (Telex):  62-820233<br>  
<b>Internet address</b>:  62820233@eln.attmail.com<br>
<br>	
All phone orders are confirmed for availability immediately on the phone. We pick up other types of orders (fax, mail, PUBNET) several times a day to assure timely confirmation of your purchase order requests.<br>
<br>
When you call to place an order, please have the following information ready:
<ul>
<li>Your account number (NACS store number)
<li>PO number
<li>Shipping instructions

<b>Backorders</b><br>
<br>
To backorder titles, simply specify on your order, or to one of our phone representative, that you would like to backorder.  Please include backorder shipping instructions.  We will then automatically reserve and commit stock to your order as it arrives.<br>
<br>
<b>Future Orders/Bin & Holds</b><br>
<br>
NACSCORP's Bin & Hold program allows you to use our warehouse to hold your stock until you�re ready to receive it.  Especially important for back-to-class time, the Bin & Hold program allows you to start your orders early, then add or subtract quantities or titles as needed.
<p><a href="#TOC"><font size=2>Return to Table of Contents</font></a></p>
<h3><a name="Shipping">SHIPPING </a></h3>
Orders are shipped within 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) from the time they are placed.  We can provide same-day shipping on &quot;RUSH&quot; orders placed before 1:30 p.m. ET.<br>
<br>	
Your account can be set up to accommodate your store�s ordering, shipping, and invoicing needs.  We can set up your account so that you can place orders, receive backorders, and be invoiced for all products under one account number.  Or, if you prefer, we can set up separate entity accounts for textbooks, general books, and computer products.<br>
<br>	
All shipments are sent FOB, Oberlin, Ohio.  Shipments via NACSCORP-selected carriers can be prepaid by NACSCORP and added to your invoice.<br>
<br>
<b>Save on Shipping Costs</b><br>
<br>
The NACSCORP 2-Day Freight Program can save you money and allow you to receive orders faster.  We offer guaranteed two-day air delivery at roughly 50% off standard rates of other popular carriers.  For stores in the west, this equates to two-day air service at Zone 8 ground rates.<br>
<br>	
The NACS Freight Program offers shipping discounts of 57% or more on truck orders.  To learn more about this program, call John Finucane at NACS (800-622-7498  ext. 2307).<br>
<br>
<b>Special Orders</b><br>
<br>
In addition to our regularly stocked items, NACSCORP lists approximately 20,000 different titles which we can special order for you.  Please allow three to five weeks for delivery of special order items.<br> 
<br>
Drop shipping and direct shipping are available in some cases.  (Drop shipping is not available for computer products.)<br>	
<br>
<b>Damaged merchandise and mis-shipments</b><br>  
<br>	
If you receive damaged or defective merchandise or a mis-shipment, please call our Customer Service line (800-458-9303) and notify one of our representatives.<br>
<br>	
Notification of damaged or defective merchandise must be made within 30 days of receipt.  If the product is damaged during shipment, please notify the carrier immediately and retain the damaged box for inspection by the carrier. 
<p><a href="#TOC"><font size=2>Return to Table of Contents</font></a></p>
<h3><a name="PAYMENT">PAYMENT TERMS </a></h3>
<b>Net 30-day terms</b><br>
<br>	
Delayed billing (extended terms) is available in fall and spring to qualified accounts.<br>
<br>
Items on your invoice can be arranged alphabetically by title, author, or publisher; or they can be listed in the same way that you place the order.<br>
<br>
<b>30-Day Price Protection</b><br>
<br>	
Your store will be notified of any computer products purchased  within the last 18 months which have a new, lower cost.  You will need to file for price protection by the specified date in order to receive credit.  Simply fax the credit claim form back and we will credit the cost difference.  Credit on subsequent returns of the product will always be issued at the new, lower cost.<br>
<br>
This is a great opportunity for you to remain competitive by being able to lower the price of your on-hand inventory without any loss in profit margin.<br>
<br>	
As an additional reference, a complete list of 
products with price protection deadlines is available on our Web site and our Fax On Demand server.  Price protection claim forms are also available from our Fax On Demand server. (Call 800-662-9759.)<br>
<br>
<b>Credit Swap</b><br>
<br>	
Our Credit Swap program allows you to exchange your unused book publisher credit memos for either 80% of the amount as a NACSCORP credit or 70% as cash.  This offer is good for credit memos from a select list of publishers.  Please call our Finance Department (800-622-7498 ext. 2236) for more information.<br>
<br>
<b>Discount Policy</b><br>
<br>	
No minimum order quantity!  Books are discounted 40% on most titles.  Many short discount and net-priced titles are available; all computer products are net priced.  Call our Inbound Sales Department for the most recent catalogs, price lists, and special promotional offers.  Further discounts are available to large volume accounts.
<p><a href="#TOC"><font size=2>Return to Table of Contents</font></a></p>
<h3><a name="RETURNS">RETURNS </a></h3>
<b>No returns penalties!</b>  For most products we will grant a full return credit as long as the items are in saleable condition (including the absence of store price stickers) and are returned within 18 months of the invoice date.<br> 
<br>	
Some of our computer products will have shorter return periods for one of the following reasons: 1) the release of a new version has made the old version obsolete, 2) the product has been discontinued, or 3) there are special vendor stipulations which cause NACSCORP to have a shorter return period.<br>
<br>	
When any of these situations arise for products you have purchased within the last 18 months, you will be notified of return deadlines via our <i>Computer Products Returns Notice</i>, which will automatically be sent to you along with <b>Expedited Return</b> shipping labels.<br>  
<br> 	
When you use the <b>Expedited Return</b> labels, please include only items that are listed in your returns notice.  Include other items in a separate shipment using General Return shipping labels.  General Return labels are sent with orders at the end of peak seasons, and can be ordered from NACSCORP at any time.  Using the NACSCORP labels will help your staff prepare returns according to the guidelines below, and help us process them more efficiently.<br> 
<br> 
<i><b>Address For Returns:</b><br>
Returns Department<br> 
NACSCORP<br> 
528 East Lorain St.<br> 
Oberlin, Ohio  44074-1298</i><br> 
<br>
<b>Guidelines For Preparing Returns</b><ol>

<li>For each item include:<br>
<br>
<b>Part number</b> (ISBN or UPC)<br>
<b>Invoice number</b> from the original purchase<br>
<b>Price information</b><br>
<br>            
If your store is equipped to prepare a computer-generated list of 
items you are returning, we encourage you to do that. If you cannot 
readily generate your own list, please provide the necessary information by photocopying the NACSCORP invoice form. Highlight the items you are returning and indicate the quantity you are sending back.  
<br><br>
<li><b>Number all of your boxes</b> so we know they are all part of the same shipment (e.g. 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3).  We encourage you to reuse boxes to cut down on waste but please be sure to cross out any old references to box numbers or shipping information.
<br><br>
<li>Mark your <b>NACS Store Number</b> and your <b>Charge Back Number</b> (if used) on all boxes so that your store receives credit for the contents of each box, and so the credit is linked to your specified charge back number.</ol>

In certain cases our Customer Service Reps give out RMAs.  If you have been given an RMA for a return, please use an <b>Expedited Return</b> labels and record your RMA in the space provided.

<B><P>Software Volume Licensing Programs</P>
</B><P>Volume Licensing Programs allow resellers to offer educational institutions a cost-effective method for purchasing multiple copies of software titles. Volume Licensing Programs offer exceptional discounts on volume purchases of titles from a growing ,list of publishers including: Microsoft, Lotus, Corel, Claris, Borland, Symantec, and Macromedia.</P>
<P>These programs enable campus resellers to become the lead source of educational licensing for the entire campus, as well as off campus sites such as grade schools or school districts.</P>
<P>Volume Licensing is one of the fastest growing product categories for educational resellers for several reasons: aggressive pricing, low minimums, no inventory to stock, low freight costs, high dollar averages per sale, and, best of all, support from NACSCORP's Licensing Specialists, which makes the whole process easy.</P>
